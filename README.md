Users can delete any todo or toggle completion status, and all changes are saved instantly in LocalStorage.  This project covers:  Fetching external API data  Storing and retrieving data from LocalStorage  Dynamic DOM rendering  Delete functionality  Status toggle (bonus)  Clean and modular JavaScript functions  Perfect for beginners learning API handling, browser storage, and dynamic UI updates.
